    <h1>About The StickyNotes App</h1>
    <h4>
        Welcome to our newest StickyNotes app! You can add as many sticky notes as you can, and they will be added to your
        screen. Feel free to use it to keep track of any stuffs you might have, and they will forever remain on your screen
        until you delete them! You can also edit or delete any existing sticky notes at any time!
        The StickyNotes App was created by David Nguyen in 2023. It's a simple and intuitive app that allows users to jot down their thoughts, tasks, or any information they'd like to keep handy.
        Notes are saved locally in your browser, ensuring you can access them anytime without needing an internet connection. Note that this app will work best with a wide screen!
        We hope you find this app useful!
